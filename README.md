TwitterPrism
============

This tool aims to create awareness among Twitter users who use words and terms government agencies are looking in the name of national security.

The scripts use 1948 terms used by institutions like NSA, GCHQ and Dept. of Homeland Security, to search for tweets containing one of those terms. It replies to the users telling them they are being watched.
